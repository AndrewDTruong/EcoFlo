# EcoFlow Project for 118i Ai4SocialGood

EcoFlow is a project designed to enhance environmental awareness and responsibility concerning storm drain maintenance in our local communities. Key features include an information and forum page utilizing text generation for educational content and community discussions, a live interactive map displaying storm drains around your local community with a report button for addressing issues, and an interactive simulation. The simulation allows users to adjust variables such as average rainfall, daily litter, population, industrial waste, and waste treatment efficiency, with a bar graph displaying pollution levels. This comprehensive approach aims to encourage proactive environmental management and sustainable practices within the university community.
